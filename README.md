The **Environmentally Assisting Robotic System** (`envi-assist`, `enviAssist`, `EA`, `envi_assist()`) is a [collective intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_intelligence#:~:text=Collective%20intelligence%20(CI)%20is%20shared,peer%20review%20and%20crowdsourcing%20applications.) system for helping human operators manage and distribute work tasks related to [agriculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture), [forestry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forestry), and [restoration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restoration_ecology).

### Theory
**Probabilistic and Statistical Machine Learning for Ecology and Sustainability (GPC 103)** is `enviAssist`'s companion Google Classroom developed to help undergraduate and graduate students apply mathematics, ecology, sustainable architecture, and design to understand, experiment, and apply classical machine learning tools for climate understanding. 

To this end, this classroom will cover (quickly) central theories and their associated applications for these respective fields. This mini-course will be divided into sections on theory and sections on practice. The theory section will outline the necessary mathematics (i.e., probability and statistic, statistical learning theory, graph theory, and linear algebra). 

### Practice
The practice sections are meant for the direct application (paper signal building, classification and forecasting model building). Practically, these models will be implemented in the R and Python programming languages. Jupyter notebooks, videos, links, and supporting notes will accompany these sections and subsections. In the end, the goal is to keep theory and practice step-by-step (or hand-in-hand), so students have a rough understanding of how to abstract and implement hypothesis in the form of computational stories.
